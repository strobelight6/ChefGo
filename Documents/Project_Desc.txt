Name: ChefGo

Description:

Many people want to avoid fast food to maintain a healthy diet, but they face several dilemmas.
Deterrents include not having the ingredients to cook, not knowing how to cook, and not having the motivation to cook.
Our application will aim to solve this problem by providing a platform on which users can request someone to cook for them or offer to cook for others.
Users will be able to create their own accounts.
These accounts will be used to request or offer a meal.
When requesting or offering, the user will be able to specify what they will be serving/what they want served, if they are willing to pay for the ingredients, and any allergies or dietary restrictions.
A chat function can be used after a customer and cook have connected in case either has any questions or concerns for the other.
A satisfaction system similar to Uber can be implemented through which the users will rate each other.
These ratings will then be visible to other users, so they can determine whether they want to accept a meal.
There will be a profile page that can be edited to display photos of yourself, photos of meals you have made, and details such as dietary restrictions.
The main page will be where users will request/offer meals and be able see the requests or offers in their area.
There will also be another page to apply to be a chef so moderators can decide if the applicant is fit to cook for people.
